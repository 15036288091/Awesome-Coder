## News

* [Parcel v1.6.0 Release](https://parg.co/UIi): Parcel v1.6.0 is a huge release that comes just 3 weeks after v1.5.0, with over 15 new features and lots of bugfixes and improvements. The highlights include: Zero config ES6+ transpilation with Babel, Automatic JSX support for React and Preact, Node and Electron targets, Production bundle statistics, Node 6 support, W3C WebManifest support.

* [npm v5.7.0 Release](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/171139955345/v570/amp): This release brings a bunch of exciting new features and bug fixes. Package-lock git merge conflict resolution allows npm install to fix package-lock.json and npm-shrinkwrap.json files that have merge conflicts in them without your having to edit them. The new npm ci command installs from your lock-file ONLY. If your package.json and your lock-file are out of sync then it will report an error, it’s also much faster (2x-10x!) than npm install when you don’t start with a node_modules. It works by throwing away your node_modules and recreating it from scratch.

* [Puppeteer v1.1.0 Release](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

## Tutorial

* [Everything you need to know about CSS Variables](https://parg.co/UIJ): Most programming languages have support for variables. But sadly, CSS has lacked support for native variables from the very beginning. Well the web is moving fast. And I’m glad to report that CSS now finally supports variables. In this guide, I’ll show you how variables work natively in CSS, and how you can use them to make your life a lot easier. I’ll wrap things up by showing you how to build 3 projects that show off CSS variables and their ease of use: Creating Component Variations using CSS Variables, Theme Styles with CSS Variables, Building the CSS Variable Booth.

## Engineering Practices

## Under the hood

* [Promises are not neutral enough](https://staltz.com/promises-are-not-neutral-enough.html): Promises in JavaScript create problems which affect the entire ecosystem. In this blog post I’ll explain some of those problems. The basic purpose of Promises is to represent a value that will be eventually available. It could become available in the next event loop or in the next minutes. Basically Promises are not neutral enough because they introduce 4 opinions: Eager, not lazy; No cancellation; Never synchronous; then() is a mix of map() and flatMap().

* [CSS Keylogging](https://github.com/maxchehab/CSS-Keylogging): CSS Keylogging contains a chrome extension and Express server that exploits keylogging abilities of CSS. This attack is really simple. Utilizing CSS attribute selectors, one can request resources from an external server under the premise of loading a background-image. Using a simple script one can create a css file that will send a custom request for every ASCII character.

* [Why Decentralization Matters](https://parg.co/UIk): During the first era of the internet — from the 1980s through the early 2000s — internet services were built on open protocols that were controlled by the internet community. During the second era of the internet, from the mid 2000s to the present, for-profit tech companies — most notably Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon (GAFA) — built software and services that rapidly outpaced the capabilities of open protocols. Decentralized platforms, by contrast, often launch half-baked and without clear use cases. Cryptonetworks are a powerful way to develop community-owned networks and provide a level playing field for 3rd-party developers, creators, and businesses.

## OpenSource

* [Proton Native](https://proton-native.js.org/#/): On mobile, the React Native gives us a seamless way to build user interfaces and manage state in code, all while doing it cross platform. Proton Native does the same to desktop that React Native did to mobile. Build cross-platform apps for the desktop, all while never leaving the React eco-system. Popular React packages such as Redux still work.

* [vue-ethereum-ipfs](https://github.com/redacademy/vue-ethereum-ipfs): It is a distributed application starter wih Vue, Ethereum and IPFS. Ethereum is a distributed virtual machine that pays eth in return for miners running your smart contracts. IPFS is a kind of distributed content distribution network. Vue is a javascript framework for building client-side webapps. By keeping state inside ethereum and using IPFS to deliver HTML, webapps can become nearly indestructable!

# Work Life

* [Hinton：人类就是机器，绝妙的机器](https://parg.co/UIa): 本文是对于深度学习之父，Geoffrey Hinton 人生与职业经历的简要介绍。三十多年来，Geoffrey Hinton 一直徘徊在人工智能研究的边缘地带。他像局外人一样坚守着一个简单的观点：计算机可以像人类一样思考，依靠直觉而不是规则。
