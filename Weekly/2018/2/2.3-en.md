## Under the hood

* [Promises are not neutral enough](https://staltz.com/promises-are-not-neutral-enough.html): Promises in JavaScript create problems which affect the entire ecosystem. In this blog post I’ll explain some of those problems. The basic purpose of Promises is to represent a value that will be eventually available. It could become available in the next event loop or in the next minutes. Basically Promises are not neutral enough because they introduce 4 opinions: Eager, not lazy; No cancellation; Never synchronous; then() is a mix of map() and flatMap().

* [CSS Keylogging](https://github.com/maxchehab/CSS-Keylogging): CSS Keylogging contains a chrome extension and Express server that exploits keylogging abilities of CSS. This attack is really simple. Utilizing CSS attribute selectors, one can request resources from an external server under the premise of loading a background-image. Using a simple script one can create a css file that will send a custom request for every ASCII character.

* [2018-Why Decentralization Matters](https://parg.co/UIk): During the first era of the internet — from the 1980s through the early 2000s — internet services were built on open protocols that were controlled by the internet community. During the second era of the internet, from the mid 2000s to the present, for-profit tech companies — most notably Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon (GAFA) — built software and services that rapidly outpaced the capabilities of open protocols. Decentralized platforms, by contrast, often launch half-baked and without clear use cases. Cryptonetworks are a powerful way to develop community-owned networks and provide a level playing field for 3rd-party developers, creators, and businesses.

## OpenSource

* [Proton Native](https://proton-native.js.org/#/): On mobile, the React Native gives us a seamless way to build user interfaces and manage state in code, all while doing it cross platform. Proton Native does the same to desktop that React Native did to mobile. Build cross-platform apps for the desktop, all while never leaving the React eco-system. Popular React packages such as Redux still work.

* [vue-ethereum-ipfs](https://github.com/redacademy/vue-ethereum-ipfs): It is a distributed application starter wih Vue, Ethereum and IPFS. Ethereum is a distributed virtual machine that pays eth in return for miners running your smart contracts. IPFS is a kind of distributed content distribution network. Vue is a javascript framework for building client-side webapps. By keeping state inside ethereum and using IPFS to deliver HTML, webapps can become nearly indestructable!
