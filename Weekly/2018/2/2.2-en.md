## News

* [Chrome will mark all HTTP sites as “not secure](https://parg.co/UXK): Google Chrome now announced that starting in Chrome 68 (to be releaded in July 2018) the browser will mark non-secure sites (HTTP) as “not secure”, marking the end of non-HTTPS websites. Developers can use latest Node CLI version of Lighthouse, an automated tool for improving web pages, to find which resources a site loads using HTTP, and which of those are ready to be upgraded to HTTPS simply by changing the subresource reference to the HTTPS version.

* [Rollup now has code-splitting](https://parg.co/UXS): As of version 0.55, Rollup, the JavaScript module bundler, finally has code-splitting, the most popular feature request for a long time. Rollup has long been the tool of choice for library authors — it powers React, Vue, D3, Moment, Three.js, Ember, Angular, Babylon, Jest, Bootstrap, Leaflet, Prettier, and thousands of other tools — but code-splitting means Rollup can now become a great choice for applications of all sizes.

* [Welcoming Progressive Web Apps to Microsoft Edge and Windows 10](https://parg.co/UXq): Edge 17 will come with Service Workers and Push Notifications, and the Microsoft Store will start listing Progressive Web Apps by manual submission which is a big step ahead for making web apps as usable as native apps. In this post, we’ll give a quick introduction to Progressive Web Apps – what they are, the problems they solve, and how we’ll be enabling them across Windows 10.

## Tutorial

* [React’s ⚛️ new Context API](https://parg.co/UXl): This post will introduce the new Conext API in React, it consists of thress main parts: React.createContext which is passed the initial value, returns an object with a Provider and a Consumer. The Provider component is used higher in the tree and accepts a prop called value (which can be anything). The Consumer component is used anywhere below the provider in the tree and accepts a prop called “children” which must be a function that accepts the value and must return a react element (JSX).

* [Service workers: the little heroes behind Progressive Web Apps](https://parg.co/UXo): Service workers are at the core of Progressive Web Apps. They allow caching of resources and push notifications, which are two of the main distinguishing features that have set native apps apart up to this point. This post will cover Background Processing, Offline Support, Precache assets during installation, Caching network requests, Installation and Basic Usage, etc.

* [Base64 is fun!](https://dev.to/legolord208/base64-is-fun--420d)

## Engineering Practices

* [Five Common Problems in GraphQL Apps (And How to Fix Them)](https://parg.co/UXd): In this article, we will learn to unlock the power of GraphQL without suffering its drawbacks. The author talks about problems such as: Schema duplication, Server/client data mismatch, Superfluous database calls, Poor performance and Boilerplate overdose. For each issue, I’ll describe the problem, and then explain how I’m addressing it inside Vulcan, a React/GraphQL open-source framework I’ve been working on over the past year.

## Under the hood

* [Evolving Patterns in React](https://parg.co/UXm): Let’s take a closer look at some of the patterns that are emerging in the React ecosystem. These patterns improve readability, code clarity, and push your code towards composition and reusability. This post will cover Conditional Render, Passing Down Props, Destructuring Props, Provider Pattern, High Order Components, Render Props, etc.

* [Front End Interview Handbook](https://github.com/yangshun/front-end-interview-handbook): Unlike typical software engineer job interviews, front-end job interviews have less emphasis on algorithms and have more questions on intricate knowledge and expertise about the domain — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, just to name a few areas. While there are some existing resources to help front end developers in preparing for interviews, they aren't as abundant as materials for a software engineer interview. Among the existing resources, probably the most helpful question bank would be Front-end Developer Interview Questions. And this post is almost complete answers to "Front-end Job Interview Questions".

## OpenSource

* [winamp2-js](https://github.com/captbaritone/winamp2-js): This is a reimplementation of Winamp 2.9 in HTML5 and JavaScript. It includes these features: Decodes the actual skin file in your browser so you can load your favorite Winamp 2 skins, Load local audio or skin files via drag-and-drop, eject button, or "options" button (upper left-hand corner), etc.

* [Rekit #JavaScript#](https://github.com/supnate/rekit): Rekit is a toolkit for building scalable web applications with React, Redux and React-router. It's an all-in-one solution for creating modern React apps. It helps you focus on business logic rather than dealing with massive libraries, patterns, configurations etc. Rekit creates apps using an opinionated folder and code structure. It's designed to be scalable, testable and maintainable by using feature oriented architecture, one action per file pattern. This ensures application logic is well grouped and decoupled.

* [WebAssemblyStudio](https://github.com/wasdk/WebAssemblyStudio): Onine studio to learn, teach, work and play WebAssembly, it supports C++ and Rust. User can build and run wasm projects in the browser, also can run a local copy, which need to install node.js and webpack on your computer.
