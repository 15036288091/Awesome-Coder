* [Propel](http://propelml.org/): Propel provides a GPU-backed numpy-like infrastructure for scientific computing in JavaScript. JavaScript is a fast, dynamic language which, we think, could act as an ideal workflow for scientific programmers of all sorts. Propel runs both in the browser and natively from Node. In both environments Propel is able to use GPU hardware for computations. In the browser it utilizes WebGL through deeplearn.js and on Node it uses TensorFlow's C API.
