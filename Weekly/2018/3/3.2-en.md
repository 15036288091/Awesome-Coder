* [Structuring projects and naming components in React](https://parg.co/Ugc): As React is just a lib, it doesn’t dictate rules about how you should organize and structure your projects. This is nice, because it gives us freedom to try different approaches and adapt the ones that better fit for us. On the other hand, this could cause some confusion for devs that are starting in React world.

* [Propel](http://propelml.org/): Propel provides a GPU-backed numpy-like infrastructure for scientific computing in JavaScript. JavaScript is a fast, dynamic language which, we think, could act as an ideal workflow for scientific programmers of all sorts. Propel runs both in the browser and natively from Node. In both environments Propel is able to use GPU hardware for computations. In the browser it utilizes WebGL through deeplearn.js and on Node it uses TensorFlow's C API.
