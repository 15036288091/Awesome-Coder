- [Neural networks from scratch for Javascript linguists【Series】](https://parg.co/bNa): so let’s go on a journey, I’ll tell you everything I learned, some misconceptions I had, how to interpret the results, and some basic vocabulary and fun facts along the way.- [谷歌工程师：聊一聊深度学习的weight initialization](http://m.leiphone.com/news/201703/3qMp45aQtbxTdzmK.html)- [A Beginner's Guide to the Mathematics of Neural Networks](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.161.3556&rep=rep1&type=pdf): In this paper I try to describe both the role of mathematics in shaping our understanding of how neural networks operate, and the curious new mathematical concepts generated by our attempts to capture neural networks in equations. My target reader being the non-expert, I will present a biased selection of relatively simple examples of neural network tasks, models and calculations, rather than try to give a full encyclopedic review-like account of the many mathematical developments in this eld.
