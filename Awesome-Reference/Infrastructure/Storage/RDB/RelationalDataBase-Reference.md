- [Tutorial: Step by Step Database Design in SQL](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tutorial-step-database-design-sql-david-mccaldin):  Database Design and Implementation is applicable for whatever industry your in. Here is a step by step approach to designing and implementing a database in your organisation, using specific data from a sweet shop case study I implemented during my M.Sc. in Software & Information Systems.
# Theorem: 数据库理论
- [2013-How did the modern relational database come to be?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-did-modern-relational-database-come-david-mccaldin): The purpose of this Annotated Bibliography is to illustrate, in chronological order, the major development of database models from 1st generation (network model etc) to second generation (relational) to 3rd generation (e.g. semantic). The Bibliography is presented in order of the year when the paper was published.

- [2017-How does a relational database work](http://coding-geek.com/how-databases-work/): When it comes to relational databases, I can’t help thinking that something is missing. They’re used everywhere. There are many different databases: from the small and useful SQLite to the powerful Teradata. But, there are only a few articles that explain how a database works.
- [2017-A beginner’s guide to ACID and database transactions](http://6me.us/OzSh): Transactions are omnipresent in today’s enterprise systems, providing data integrity even in highly concurrent environments. So let’s get started by first defining the term and the context where you might usually employ it.
