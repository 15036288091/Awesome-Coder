Throughout this magical journey, a number of patterns have come up that I find myself repeating again and again.

Using recompose looks very different from “vanilla” React; so you will also get comfortable with the look and feel of a “recomposed” component. The best part is no more need for class components! You’ll learn how to use Recompose to both modify components and also create your own higher-order components.

- [2017-Why you should keep your react components pure by using HOCs](https://hackernoon.com/why-you-should-keep-your-react-components-pure-by-using-hocs-67e5c7f80c81): In this article I show how decomposing state from the presentational layer can both reduce complexity and promote code re-use with some React examples— a win-win situation helping to tame the challenges of developing SPAs. Although I’m using React, the lessons are universal and can apply to any framework.

# Performance: 性能优化

- [React Office Site —— Optimizing Performance](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/optimizing-performance.html): For many applications, using React will lead to a fast user interface without doing much work to specifically optimize for performance. Nevertheless, there are several ways you can speed up your React application.

- [2017-Our Best Practices for Writing React Components](https://engineering.musefind.com/our-best-practices-for-writing-react-components-dec3eb5c3fc8#.3kin14vrf): When I first started writing React, I remember seeing many different approaches to writing components, varying greatly from tutorial to tutorial. Though the framework has matured considerably since then, there doesn’t seem to yet be a firm ‘right’ way of doing things.
