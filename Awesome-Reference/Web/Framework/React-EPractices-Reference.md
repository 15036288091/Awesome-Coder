# StyleGuide & Design Pattern: 样式指南与设计模式

- [2017-10 React mini-patterns](https://hackernoon.com/10-react-mini-patterns-c1da92f068c5#.5v2hpgurn): Over the last few years, I’ve worked on a handful of decent-sized React projects, and many, many pint-sized ones. Throughout this magical journey, a number of patterns have come up that I find myself repeating again and again.

- [2017-Higher Order Components with Functional Patterns Using Recompose](https://egghead.io/courses/higher-order-components-with-functional-patterns-using-recompose): In this course, you will learn to use many of the most powerful and convenient higher-order components within Recompose by coding several real-world examples. Using recompose looks very different from “vanilla” React; so you will also get comfortable with the look and feel of a “recomposed” component. The best part is no more need for class components! You’ll learn how to use Recompose to both modify components and also create your own higher-order components.

- [2017-Why you should keep your react components pure by using HOCs](https://hackernoon.com/why-you-should-keep-your-react-components-pure-by-using-hocs-67e5c7f80c81): In this article I show how decomposing state from the presentational layer can both reduce complexity and promote code re-use with some React examples— a win-win situation helping to tame the challenges of developing SPAs. Although I’m using React, the lessons are universal and can apply to any framework.
