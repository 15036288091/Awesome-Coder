- [2017-A Love Letter to CSS](https://parg.co/biC): Today I’m going to try to convince you that not only is CSS one of the best technologies you use on a day-to-day basis, not only is CSS incredibly well designed, but that you should be thankful—thankful!—each and every time you open a .css file.

## Overview: 概览

- [2017-The invisible parts of CSS](https://madebymike.com.au/writing/the-invisible-parts-of-CSS/#cascade): If you use CSS in your daily work, your primary goal is probably focused around making things ‘look right’.

## Compatibility: 兼容性
- [CSS Compatibility in Internet Explorer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh781508%28v=vs.85%29.aspx): Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 was the first fully Cascading Style Sheets, Level 1 (CSS1)-compliant version of Internet Explorer. Windows Internet Explorer 8 is fully compliant with the Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2 Revision 1 (CSS2.1) specification and supports some features of Cascading Style Sheets, Level 3 (CSS3). Windows Internet Explorer 9 and Internet Explorer 10 add even more support for many CSS3 modules.
