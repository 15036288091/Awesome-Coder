 - [WebAssembly Reference- [2017-WebAssembly: Mozilla Won](http://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/06/webassembly-mozilla-won.html): Mozilla staff are being very diplomatic and restrained by allowing WebAssembly to be portrayed as a compromise between the approaches of asm.js and PNaCl. They have good reasons for being so, but I can be a bit less restrained. asm.js and PNaCl represented quite different visions for how C/C++ code should be supported on the Web, and I think WebAssembly is a big victory for asm.js and Mozilla's vision.- [2016-awesome-wasm](https://github.com/mbasso/awesome-wasm/blob/master/README.md): Collection of awesome things regarding WebAssembly (wasm) ecosystem.- [2017-Understanding WebAssembly text format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format): To enable WebAssembly to be read and edited by humans, there is a textual representation of the wasm binary format. This is an intermediate form designed to exposed in text editors, browser developer tools, etc. This article explains how that text format works, in terms of the raw syntax, and how it is related to the underlying bytecode it represents — and the wrapper objects representing wasm in JavaScript.- [2017-Execute millions of SQL statements in milliseconds in the browser with WebAssembly and Web Workers.](https://hackernoon.com/execute-millions-of-sql-statements-in-milliseconds-in-the-browser-with-webassembly-and-web-workers-3e0b25c3f1a6#.wmwgurgvu) - [2017-A cartoon intro to WebAssembly](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-cartoon-intro-to-webassembly/): WebAssembly is fast.
