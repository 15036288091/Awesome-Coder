# Functional Programming: 函数式编程

* [Functional Programming In JavaScript【Series 】](http://6me.us/1P1r): Functional Programming(FP) can change the way you program for the better. But it’s hard to learn and many posts and tutorials don’t go into details like Monads, Applicative and so on and don’t seem to use practical examples to help us use powerful FP techniques on a daily basis. That’s why I thought of writing a post to make it easier to use FP techniques.

* [2016-Eric Elliott: Composing Software](http://6me.us/SJr7): series on learning functional programming and compositional software techniques in JavaScript ES6+ from the ground up.
