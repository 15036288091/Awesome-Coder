- [What’s a JavaScript closure? In plain English, please.](http://6me.us/PxYRL): Every function in JavaScript has a closure. And this is one of the coolest features of the JavaScript language. Because without closures, it would be hard to implement common structures like callbacks or event handlers.

# Functional Programming: 函数式编程

- [Functional Programming In JavaScript【Series】](http://6me.us/1P1r): Functional Programming(FP) can change the way you program for the better. But it’s hard to learn and many posts and tutorials don’t go into details like Monads, Applicative and so on and don’t seem to use practical examples to help us use powerful FP techniques on a daily basis. That’s why I thought of writing a post to make it easier to use FP techniques.
