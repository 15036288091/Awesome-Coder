- [7 tips to handle undefined in JavaScript](https://rainsoft.io/7-tips-to-handle-undefined-in-javascript/): When I started to learn JavaScript about eight years ago, a bizarre situation for me was the existence of both undefined and null that represent empty values. What is the clear difference between them? They both seem to define empty values, and moreover the comparison null == undefined evaluates to true.

## Regular Expressions: 正则表达式

- [Regular Expressions in a post-ES6 world](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/regular-expressions-post-es6): In this article we’ll take a look at regular expressions in and after ES6. There’s a couple of regular expressions flags which were introduced in ES6: the /y or sticky flag, and the /u or Unicode flag. Then we’ll discuss five proposals which are making their way through the ECMAScript specification development process at TC39.

- [Learn Regular Expressions for Beginners](https://hackernoon.com/javascript-learn-regular-expressions-for-beginners-bb6107015d91): In JavaScript, a regular expression is simply a type of object that is used to match character combinations in strings.

- [2017-Faster Collection Iterators](http://benediktmeurer.de/2017/07/14/faster-collection-iterators/)：ECMAScript 2015 中引入了 Map 与 Set 等常用的集合，这些集合同样实现了迭代器的特性，因此也就允许我们使用 `for-of` 或者扩展操作符来迭代操作这些集合。不过在很多的评测中这些新引入的集合的迭代遍历性能并不是很好，本文则详细介绍了引擎中导致 Set 等集合迭代性能较差的原因，并且给出了解决方案与未来的实现规划。

- [What You Should Know About ES6 Maps](https://hackernoon.com/what-you-should-know-about-es6-maps-dc66af6b9a1e#.w282eacyx): JavaScript ES6 introduces a new data structure, called maps. Maps are designed as an alternative to using Object literals for storing key/value pairs that require unique keys, and provide very useful methods for iteration.
