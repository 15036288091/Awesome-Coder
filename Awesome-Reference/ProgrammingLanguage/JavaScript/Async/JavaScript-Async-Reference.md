## Promise


- [2017-How to make the fastest Promise library](https://parg.co/bhz): I have developed Aigle which is a fast Promise library. It is inspired byBluebird. The library is not only a benchmark exercise but a production-ready library that implements the Promise A+ standard, and does so faster than Bluebird.
